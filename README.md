Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are not concrete implementations but rather templates or blueprints that can be adapted to fit specific situations.
Benefits of Using Design Patterns
Improved code quality: By following established patterns, code becomes more readable, maintainable, and extensible.
Faster development: Patterns offer pre-tested solutions, saving time and effort.
Better collaboration: Using a common design language enhances teamwork.
Enhanced problem-solving skills: Understanding patterns expands your problem-solving repertoire.
Categorization of Design Patterns
Creational Patterns: Concerned with object instantiation. (e.g., Factory, Singleton, Builder)
Factory Method : it is a design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling
between the creator and the created objects. Â  
prototype pattern:Prototype Pattern is like making a copy of something. Instead of creating a new object from scratch, you copy an existing one and then make changes as needed.
This saves time and effort, especially when creating complex objects.
Structural Patterns: Deal with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
Adapter Pattern: it's used when you have two parts that don't fit together. The adapter creates a bridge between them, making them work together smoothly.
Composite Pattern is like building with blocks. You can use a single block, or you can combine many blocks to make a bigger structure.
The key is that you treat both the single block and the combined structure the same way.
Behavioral Patterns: Describe the interaction and responsibilities between objects. (e.g., Observer, Strategy, Template Method)
observerPattern:Observer Pattern: Imagine subscribing to a newspaper. You (the observer) want to know when new articles (updates) are available.
The newspaper (subject) notifies all subscribers when there's a new issue.
StrategyPattern:Strategy Pattern: Think of a car with different driving modes (eco, sport, comfort). You can choose the mode based on your needs. The car (context) uses a different strategy (driving mode) to operate.
